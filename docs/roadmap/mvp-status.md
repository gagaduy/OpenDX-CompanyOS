## Latest Validation Evidence

- Repository audit: run before each handoff.
- Runtime validation: begins in Phase 1 after application scaffolding exists.
- Phase 1 plan created; implementation validation begins after scaffold execution.
- Phase 1 validation: `git diff --check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:py`, `pnpm audit:repo`, and Docker Compose config all passed.
- Phase 2 spec drafted for backend/domain-first Company Operating Core.
- Phase 2 implementation plan drafted for domain contracts, in-memory repository, read-only API routes, documentation, and full validation.
- Phase 2 validation: domain tests, API tests, root TypeScript validation, Python tests, repository audit, Docker Compose config validation, and full `pnpm check` passed.

## Open Risks

- Company Core persistence is not implemented.
- Real SSO login flow is not implemented.
- Workflow, agent runtime, and GraphRAG behavior are not implemented.
